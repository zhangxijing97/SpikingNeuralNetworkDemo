1. **Neuron**: The basic unit of the nervous system, responsible for processing and transmitting information.

2. **Synapse**: The junction between two neurons where information is transmitted from one neuron to another.

3. **Axon**: Transmits signals away from the cell body, usually one per neuron, can be long, often myelinated, smooth structure.

## Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron Model

### Fundamental Concept
**Membrane Potential:** electrical potential difference across the membrane of a neuron or other excitable cell. This potential difference arises due to the distribution of ions across the cell membrane and their movement through ion channels.<br>

The membrane potential V is defined as:<br>
V = Vinside ‚àí Voutside<br>
Vinside ‚Äãis the electrical potential inside the cell(neuron).<br>
Voutside is the electrical potential outside the cell(neuron).<br>

**Membrane Time Constant œÑm:** œÑ represents a time constant, The subscript m stands for "membrane".

œÑm = RC
- R is the membrane resistance. With higher resistance, the membrane potential changes more slowly because the current flow is reduced.
- C is the membrane capacitance. With higher capacitance, the membrane can store more charge, leading to a slower change in membrane potential for a given input current.

Example:
Membrane resistance ùëÖ = 10MŒ©
Membrane capacitance ùê∂ = 100pF
Membrane time constant œÑm = RC = 10√ó100 = 1000ms

### Model Description
The **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** neuron is a simple model that describes how a neuron's membrane potential evolves over time and generates spikes. The membrane potential V of the neuron is governed by the following differential equation:

œÑm(dt/dV(t)) = ‚àí(V(t)‚àíVrest)+RmI(t)

where:
- œÑm is the membrane time constant (the time it takes for the membrane potential to decay to 1/e of its value).
- V(t) is the membrane potential at time t.
- Vrest is the resting potential (the potential at which the neuron is at rest).
- Rm is the membrane resistance.
- I(t) is the input current at time t.

-  œÑm is the membrane time constant

### Dynamics of the LIF Model
1. **Integration**:
   - The input current I(t) causes the membrane potential V(t) to increase.
   - The term -(V(t)‚àíVrest) represents the "leak" that causes the membrane potential to decay back towards the resting potential Vrest.

2. **Firing**:
   - When the membrane potential V(t) reaches a certain threshold Vth, the neuron "fires" or generates a spike.
   - After firing, the membrane potential is reset to a lower value Vreset.

3. **Refractory Period**:
   - After a spike, there may be a refractory period during which the neuron is unable to fire again, allowing the neuron to reset.

### Summary
The LIF model is a simple yet powerful way to describe the dynamics of a neuron's membrane potential and its spiking behavior. The key components of the model are:
- The integration of input currents that increase the membrane potential.
- The leakage that causes the membrane potential to decay.
- The threshold mechanism that triggers spikes when the membrane potential reaches a certain value.

This model is widely used in computational neuroscience to study neural behavior and network dynamics.
