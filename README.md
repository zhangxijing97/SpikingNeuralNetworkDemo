# SpikingNeuralNetworksDemo

1. **Neuron**: The basic unit of the nervous system, responsible for processing and transmitting information.

2. **Synapse**: The junction between two neurons where information is transmitted from one neuron to another.

3. **Axon**: Transmits signals away from the cell body, usually one per neuron, can be long, often myelinated, smooth structure.

4. **Dendrite**: Receives signals toward the cell body, many per neuron, short and branched, not myelinated, tree-like structure.

5. **Neuromorphic**: Referring to the design and development of hardware and software systems inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

6. **Synaptic Plasticity**: The ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, in response to increases or decreases in their activity.

7. **Neurotransmitter**: Chemicals that transmit signals across a synapse from one neuron to another.

## The Coming Revolution

### Exciting Times for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
- New ways to train SNNs.
- Development of neuromorphic hardware.
- Low power consumption.

### Advantages of Computation with SNNs
- **Fast Computation / Rapid Decision-Making**: The ability of SNNs to process information and make decisions quickly, often in real-time.
- **Multiplexing**: Simultaneous processing and transmission of multiple signals or types of information over a single channel or pathway.

### Neuromorphic Hardware
- Mimics the brain's architecture for massive parallelism.
- Designed for efficient use of power and resources.
- Enables real-time adaptation and rapid decision-making.

### Synaptic Plasticity
- The ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time in response to increases or decreases in activity.

### Neurotransmitters
- Chemicals that transmit signals across a synapse from one neuron to another.

### Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
- Computational models inspired by neural circuits in the brain.
- Used for tasks such as pattern recognition and machine learning.

### Key Points
- **Neuron**: Basic unit of the nervous system, processes and transmits information.
- **Synapse**: Junction between two neurons for signal transmission.
- **Axon**: Long, thread-like part of a neuron transmitting impulses away from the cell body.
- **Dendrite**: Branched projections of a neuron receiving signals from other neurons.

## Summary
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and neuromorphic hardware offer significant advantages in terms of speed, efficiency, and real-time processing, drawing inspiration from the structure and function of the human brain.
