1. **Neuron**: The basic unit of the nervous system, responsible for processing and transmitting information.

2. **Synapse**: The junction between two neurons where information is transmitted from one neuron to another.

3. **Axon**: Transmits signals away from the cell body, usually one per neuron, can be long, often myelinated, smooth structure.

## Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron Model

### Model Description
The **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** neuron is a simple model that describes how a neuron's membrane potential evolves over time and generates spikes. The membrane potential \( V \) of the neuron is governed by the following differential equation:

\[ \tau_m \frac{dV(t)}{dt} = - (V(t) - V_{rest}) + R_m I(t) \]

where:
- \( \tau_m \) is the membrane time constant (the time it takes for the membrane potential to decay to 1/e of its value).
- \( V(t) \) is the membrane potential at time \( t \).
- \( V_{rest} \) is the resting potential (the potential at which the neuron is at rest).
- \( R_m \) is the membrane resistance.
- \( I(t) \) is the input current at time \( t \).

### Dynamics of the LIF Model
1. **Integration**:
   - The input current \( I(t) \) causes the membrane potential \( V(t) \) to increase.
   - The term \( - (V(t) - V_{rest}) \) represents the "leak" that causes the membrane potential to decay back towards the resting potential \( V_{rest} \).

2. **Firing**:
   - When the membrane potential \( V(t) \) reaches a certain threshold \( V_{th} \), the neuron "fires" or generates a spike.
   - After firing, the membrane potential is reset to a lower value \( V_{reset} \).

3. **Refractory Period**:
   - After a spike, there may be a refractory period during which the neuron is unable to fire again, allowing the neuron to reset.

### Summary
The LIF model is a simple yet powerful way to describe the dynamics of a neuron's membrane potential and its spiking behavior. The key components of the model are:
- The integration of input currents that increase the membrane potential.
- The leakage that causes the membrane potential to decay.
- The threshold mechanism that triggers spikes when the membrane potential reaches a certain value.

This model is widely used in computational neuroscience to study neural behavior and network dynamics.
