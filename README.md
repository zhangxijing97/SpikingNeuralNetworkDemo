# SpikingNeuralNetworksDemo

1. **Neuron**: The basic unit of the nervous system, responsible for processing and transmitting information.

2. **Synapse**: The junction between two neurons where information is transmitted from one neuron to another.

3. **Axon**: The long, thread-like part of a neuron that transmits impulses away from the cell body.

4. **Dendrite**: The branched projections of a neuron that receive signals from other neurons.

5. **Spiking Neural Network**: A type of artificial neural network that mimics the way biological neurons communicate using discrete spikes.

6. **Neuromorphic**: Referring to the design and development of hardware and software systems inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

7. **Synaptic Plasticity**: The ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, in response to increases or decreases in their activity.

8. **Neural Network**: A computational model inspired by the way neural circuits in the brain process information.

9. **Artificial Neural Network**: A computing system made up of artificial neurons, inspired by the human brain, used for tasks such as pattern recognition and machine learning.

10. **Neurotransmitter**: Chemicals that transmit signals across a synapse from one neuron to another.
