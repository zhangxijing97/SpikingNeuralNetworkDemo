## Introduction

### Key Terms

1. **Neuron**: The basic unit of the nervous system, responsible for processing and transmitting information.
2. **Synapse**: The junction between two neurons where information is transmitted from one neuron to another.
3. **Axon**: Transmits signals away from the cell body, usually one per neuron, can be long, often myelinated, smooth structure.
4. **Dendrite**: Receives signals toward the cell body, many per neuron, short and branched, not myelinated, tree-like structure.
5. **Neuromorphic**: Referring to the design and development of hardware and software systems inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
6. **Synaptic Plasticity**: The ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, in response to increases or decreases in their activity.

## Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron Model

### Fundamental Concept

**Membrane Time Constant $\tau_m$:** œÑ represents a time constant, The subscript m stands for "membrane".
$\tau_m$ = RC
- R is the membrane resistance. With higher resistance, the membrane potential changes more slowly because the current flow is reduced.
- C is the membrane capacitance. With higher capacitance, the membrane can store more charge, leading to a slower change in membrane potential for a given input current.

Example:
Membrane resistance ùëÖ = 10MŒ©
Membrane capacitance ùê∂ = 100pF
Membrane time constant œÑm = RC = 10√ó100 = 1000ms

**Membrane Potential:** electrical potential difference across the membrane of a neuron or other excitable cell. This potential difference arises due to the distribution of ions across the cell membrane and their movement through ion channels.<br>

The membrane potential V$V$is defined as:<br>
$V = V_{\text{inside}} ‚àí V_{\text{outside}}$<br>
$V_{\text{inside}}$ ‚Äãis the electrical potential inside the cell(neuron).<br>
$V_{\text{outside}}$ is the electrical potential outside the cell(neuron).<br>

### Model Description
The **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** neuron is a simple model that describes how a neuron's membrane potential evolves over time and generates spikes. Main function of using the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model is to obtain the membrane potential V[t] at any given moment t and to analyze V over a period of time. The membrane potential V of the neuron is governed by the following differential equation:

$$\tau_m \frac{dV(t)}{dt} = - (V(t) - V_{\text{rest}}) + R I(t)$$

where:
- $\tau_m$ is the membrane time constant, which represents the rate at which the membrane potential decays over time.
- $V(t)$ is the membrane potential at time t.
- $V_{\text{rest}}$ is the resting potential (the potential at which the neuron is at rest).
- $R$ is the membrane resistance.
- $I(t)$ is the input current at time t.

### Key Features
1. **Leakage Term**: The term $$- (V(t) - V_{\text{rest}})$$ represents the leakage of the membrane potential towards the resting potential Vrest. This term ensures that the membrane potential decays back to the resting potential in the absence of input current.

2. **Input Current**: The term RI(t) represents the input current scaled by the membrane resistance. This term drives the membrane potential towards depolarization(less negative) when there is input current.

### Equations in Discrete Time

In a discrete-time simulation, the LIF model can be approximated as:

$$V[t + \Delta t] = V[t] + \frac{\Delta t}{\tau_m} \left( - (V[t] - V_{\text{rest}}) + R I[t] \right)$$

where $\Delta t$ is the time step of the simulation.

Example:<br>
tau = 20.0         # Membrane time constant (ms)<br>
R = 1.0            # Membrane resistance (Ohms)<br>
V_rest = -65.0     # Resting membrane potential (mV)<br>
V_th = -50.0       # Threshold potential (mV)<br>
V_reset = -65.0    # Reset potential after firing (mV)<br>
I = 20.0           # Increased input current (uA/cm^2)<br>
dt = 0.1           # Time step (ms)<br>

$$V[t + \Delta t] = V[t] + \frac{\Delta t}{\tau_m} \left( - (V[t] - V_{\text{rest}}) + R I[t] \right)$$

$$V[0 + 0.1] = -65 + \frac{0.1}{20.0} \left( - ((-65) - (-65)) + 1 \times 20.0 \right)$$

$$V[0.1] = 64.9$$

### Dynamics of the LIF Model
1. **Integration**:
   - The input current I(t) causes the membrane potential V(t) to increase.
   - The term -(V(t)‚àíVrest) represents the "leak" that causes the membrane potential to decay back towards the resting potential Vrest.

2. **Firing**:
   - When the membrane potential V(t) reaches a certain threshold Vth, the neuron "fires" or generates a spike.
   - After firing, the membrane potential is reset to a lower value Vreset.

3. **Refractory Period**:
   - After a spike, there may be a refractory period during which the neuron is unable to fire again, allowing the neuron to reset.
